[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger/compare/v0.0.2...v1.0.0)

* Use `eslint-config-stripes` to provide base for ESLint rules.
* Add [Jenkins support](Jenkinsfile), including a no-op `yarn test` rule.
* Add boilerplate: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, [Additional information section](README.md#additional-information).
* Add table of contents to [`README`](README.md).
* Fix some documentation typos.
